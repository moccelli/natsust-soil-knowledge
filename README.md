# natsust-soil-knowledge
This repo contains the dataset and the R scripts for replicating the analysis of Occelli et al. "Traditional knowledge Smallholder affects soil management ability of smallholder farmers in marginal areas" - article accepted at Agronomy for Sustainable Development (2021).

- The file *Knowledge_PCA_1.xls* and the script *knowledge_pca* replicate the PCA analysis of knowledge dimensions (Fig.1D);
- The file *soil_data.xlsx* and the script *soil_residuals* replicate the calculation of soil ability stemming from soil data;
- The file *Soil_ability.xlsx* contains the final calculation of the soil ability indicator for each farmer;
- *Ability_knowledge_master.xlsx* is the main dataset and includes soil and survey data for both study sites;
- The code *soil ability_knowledge* replicates Tab.2 and Tab.3 of the paper and Tab. S1, Tab. S2 in the supplementary;
- The code *soil_knowledge_figures* replicates Fig.2 and Fig. 3 of the paper and Fig. SF1, Fig. SF2 in the supplementary.
